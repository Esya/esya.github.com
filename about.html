  <h1 class="lowercase">/ about</h1>

  <p>
    Passionate developer, trying to learn more and more every day. Started developing at 12
    by randomly hacking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILOVEYOU">ILOVEYOU</a>, made
    a 1M+ user app at 17, kept hacking/playing/tinkering since then. I have more than <b>8 years</b>
    of experience with PHP although I now try to move towards Node/Erlang/Ruby. Crazy in love with
    continous integration and smooth workflows.
    Currently living in India, working for <a href="http://www.krds.com">KRDS</a>.
